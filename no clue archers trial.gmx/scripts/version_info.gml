Intro:
    roger:  I wonder why the king has summoned us all here today.
    king:  Hear ye, hear ye, We are under attack by our demon neighbors!  I know
        many of you are probably wondering why they are invading!  let me assure you,  
        I have no...
        Idea why.  But we must defend ourselves... (angry face)
        and fight back.

Level one:
    king:  Here they come!  You! new recruit, take up arms!
    cody:  Quick, I'll teach you!
        Shoot the incoming demons!  Put your finger on the white circle then 
        drag and release to shoot.
    Roger:  What are you talking about???
    cody:  sorry...
    --play--
    cody: we stopped them for now, but they'll be back
        
Level two: 
    cody:  we're back, and this time, I brought you some help.
        you can shoot from multiple towers.
    Roger:  does this guy ever make sense?

Level three:
